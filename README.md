# Venny's Profession Mechanic Reffect Megapack

*If you find this useful and have some spare coin to tip, you can mail Oro Blanco in game.*

A collection of additional visual elements for a few profession mechanics and weapons with hard to track buff icons or trait interactions.
Some of them feature minor animations so they will look better in motion!

These are meant to look somewhat cohesive with the existing UI style, using fairly minimalistic graphics or reusing exising UI assets.

A few examples (You can see an in-depth list of features after the How to use section):

**Thief Spear combo tracking**

<img width="357" height="257" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21c4ed63-6b89-4cc3-89bc-8e5874248962" />

**Necromancer Spear and Harbinger Blight**

<img width="472" height="243" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b871d286-4da8-4705-af5a-788855c380cd" />

**Conduit Affinity and Cosmic Wisdom Forms**

<img width="512" height="273" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1c72a39-40fa-499e-bee2-2e0502e4c428" />

**Untamed's Unleash**

<img width="475" height="271" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41355dcb-256d-45e4-aa41-2cd826ab0421" />

# How to Use

First, download the zip file to your reffect root folder like so:

<img width="566" height="217" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/057fbcc0-937b-4401-b915-e8da593e2daf" />

Then right click > Extract here (the necessary files will be added to the packs and icons subfolders).

Then, return to reffect ingame and refresh packs.

Finally, enable your interface size of choice:

<img width="210" height="116" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9dcbfa0-9476-4101-aed2-ecacdb1a3976" />

<img width="589" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8e6cf96-18f7-4a0c-b00e-c8b0c2d9a68d" />

Some features have additional options you may want to look into as well, which you can enable much in the same way. They will be listed in the corresponding category.

# Features

# Warrior

## Berserker

Tracks  **Berserk mode duration**, which can be increased dynamically through Rage skills or certain traits.
This is intended to be used mostly for people learning the spec, to warn you about berserk mode extensions. 
Contains two options. Type 1 is based off of the revenant energy bar. Type 2 is a more simplified version.

Due to limitations on how reffect tracks buffs, durations over 5 seconds cannot be tracked, so this bar will cap at 5 seconds, and display arrows if you are over the cap.
While under 5 seconds, the bar will start to drain, and the berserk icon will pulse.

Also, due to a fairly common bug with mounting resetting the F2 skill, the bar has been kept at a size where it fits outside of Berserk mode, so that it doesn't overlap graphics if this bug ocurs. It also makes it fit snuggly when outside of berserk. Unfortunately, this is a game bug and thus, unless fixed by the devs, cannot be avoided.

**Type 1**

<img width="795" height="191" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fdaa35d-ee87-4803-9541-1f6b97611dbe" />
<img width="408" height="174" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26cd25c7-8c99-4da1-a954-ce3d022d135a" />
<img width="418" height="217" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30214aca-e6db-409f-ba95-1cec7a5c2f18" />

**Type 2**

<img width="384" height="198" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23730a21-9770-4c21-841a-61739e6a9e08" />

Can be toggled under Warrior > Berserker:

<img width="152" height="91" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1eefb6e0-d1d6-4575-a0aa-a1979edc32e7" />

## Spellbreaker

Tracks stacks of **Attacker's Insight** (up to 5) which is obtained on disable or boonstrip, granting 50 Power, Precision and Ferocity per stack. 
This mechanic is quite crucial to maximizing Spellbreaker damage and felt like it was a part of its core design.

<img width="815" height="176" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6a2b3a3-81d6-4d97-89c9-01c79079edbf" />
<img width="840" height="204" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af7fbecb-5847-43cf-898e-973f4d5a18cb" />

# Guardian

## Firebrand

Tracks stacks of **Swift Scholar**, obtained once per tome skill. Since the buff **grants pages once you reach the third stack** and removes itself, it will only go up to 2. Because of this, there are two options for this UI so you can pick whichever is more intuitive for you. 2 bars or 3 bars with the first filling up inmediately. In either case, you will be granted a page when using a tome skill when the bar is full.

<img width="467" height="212" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b13e2bd-ec92-4b2e-a54a-8e17a4640ef8" />
<img width="436" height="220" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25799016-2d59-4c04-8e81-8dedc5a65a17" />

## Willbender

Tracks **Willbender Flames' buffs** on the profession UI.

<img width="395" height="254" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3b0fd2e-ca22-430c-85d4-bba5d7811c48" />

## Luminary

Tracks **Luminary's Blessing** and currently **equipped Radiant Weapon buff**, in and out of Forge.

<img width="438" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1077c2de-01e7-4034-90a6-a5598e1e1c82" />

If **Sovereign of Light** is equipped, additionally **tracks Light Aura**, so you know when to detonate it.

<img width="406" height="179" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb7a9517-3eb2-4613-93e5-16e16887ac31" />

If **Empowered Armaments** is equipped, adds an additional tracker for its duration.

<img width="395" height="225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e106a78-25eb-48d0-92c3-26678556a484" />


Additionally, turns the separator between F3 and F4 black to be consistent with other elite specs.

# Revenant

## Spear

Tracks the stack count of **Abyssal Raze** and, if the duration is under 5 seconds, will also display it's timer.

<img width="147" height="137" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0c74e13-dd94-43b1-96fa-a1fbedab29bb" />

## Conduit

Tracks **Affinity** over the health bar, styled after Razah's helmet.

<img width="788" height="323" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4a439be-585f-45ba-bdfd-7b235c5c4c93" />
<img width="919" height="304" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74bad7d8-8e37-4401-b905-c154afff5aba" />

Tracks **Cosmic Wisdom** duration along with your **active form**. 

<img width="477" height="281" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/619933b2-af2c-4290-a9ba-7c61706fe2d4" />
<img width="401" height="310" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adb62077-8aac-46c1-a24d-3e7e682d7a32" />

If **Kinetic Insight** is equipped adds 2 Affinity, but not over 5.

<img width="879" height="277" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7503e84-8a85-44a9-9ee4-4e7b17b11d66" />
<img width="809" height="283" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a2b8220-de66-45f0-915e-8ebdf274bddb" />

# Ranger

## Untamed

Helps tracking **Unleash Pet / Unleash Ranger state**. It also **tracks Unleashed Power (trait) cooldown** to let you know when you are ready to unleash.

When in Unleash Pet state, and Unleashed Power is available (both icons on the left side line up) you'll be ready to Ambush.

<img width="768" height="309" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9852d0f-d7ac-4179-b78a-0f2abf321e00" />

During Ambush windows, the Untamed icon will light up. This checks for if your skill slot 1 has any of the ambush skills available.

<img width="802" height="312" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fb17e78-ca3d-4da9-95fc-b5594d581782" />

If the trait **Let Loose** is equipped, an additional element will be added. This time lining up on the right side, as you must be in Unleashed Ranger state to perform this. It will indicate when you are ready to get an Ambush by weapon swapping:

<img width="928" height="330" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/592945b3-5224-4736-9abb-f294958f5c4e" />

**Note**: Due to technical limitations with reffect, this is achieved by tracking your current weapon swap cooldown. Bear in mind this trait only works in combat, so it will appear to have a very short 1 second cooldown out of combat. Additionally, any change to your weapon swap reduction, like Relic of the Warrior, will shorten your weapon swap and make it not align with the trait cooldown, and thus is not recommended to be used with this trait.

## Galeshot

Used to track **Wind Force stacks**. 

<img width="357" height="260" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63726dc7-85c9-4bf0-8a53-bd28871dd0b4" />

Additionally, an option to add a duplicate **arrow counter** above it is also included. Since both resources are tied together, I find this easier to keep track of than the regular arrow UI. 
If you feel like this display is too much clutter, you can disable the Feathers group.

<img width="218" height="95" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58faa031-d94e-4e4f-9041-56b219f44491" />

# Engineer

A lot of people requested a way to keep track of **kit skill cooldowns**. Cooldown trackers for hidden skills is specifically against the rules for addons, so it will **not be supported**.

## Amalgam

Tracks **Evolve** and **Strain** durations. 

<img width="424" height="281" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07943e30-81b1-42ac-b303-dc799873ce4f" />

Also tracks **Willing Host**.

<img width="378" height="232" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94ce33b4-af74-49ce-a798-73ecd739bfea" />


If the trait **Silver Lining** is equipped, strains will be tracked individually. 
(They will display on top of Morph skills, although their position will not necessarily match the corresponding Morph skill, as Reffect doesn't allow to track both buff and skill cooldowns at the same time).

<img width="392" height="222" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87f81386-386b-4b4d-8121-0444e4148d6f" />

# Thief

## Stealth

Displays Stealth and Revealed over Profession Skill 1.

<img width="447" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ce64064-3d49-4d3d-b40d-e853d90ed02b" />
<img width="421" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/670e4a3b-8760-4ab7-82b4-d08093948f76" />

## Spear

Helps keep track of the **Spear's Combo Chains**, as well as **Distracting Throw**'s uptime.

This pack comes with two options. Spear icons or simple icons. Spear icons use the icons for slot 2 since they have generally more distinctive graphics, being animal themed:

<img width="470" height="247" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38b3caab-7fef-4fa9-9569-433350776819" />
<img width="427" height="235" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c6cc342-8aa4-46c2-9d41-a8014bdc05f2" />

Simple mode, closely resembling initiative:

<img width="402" height="220" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/120553f7-1ada-4b77-8286-6de0528d57bc" />

Enable / Disable Icons or Simple Icons under Thief Spear:

<img width="228" height="159" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6a52fd4-ef65-4fd6-b1c0-9ae949061269" />

**Note**: I wanted to have this element centered over initiative, but because of the special action button, this would cause overlap when it appears, so by default it's out of the way. If you'd prefer to have it centered, despite it being covered when SAK appears, you can just move it under Thief > Thief Spear.

<img width="421" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecf48e6f-a7f3-4036-b96f-a1bbfb86bf95" />


## Axe

Tracks the number of active axes. Also, if at max stacks, the axe icon will light up. You may disable this if you like.

<img width="451" height="248" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d9be557-a1cb-450c-bcf4-5c720f99b634" />
<img width="366" height="268" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3431e37-1ac3-4663-bb67-12d8a2a06728" />
<img width="471" height="274" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fee3300-5cae-4279-bf8b-aa718500200e" />

**Note**: If you use the Axe and Spear together, they might overlap, and you will have to move one of them out of the way. Since thief generally doesn't use two weapons actively due to how initiative works, and it's rare to use Spear and Axe together, I left them in their default position. You can move them if you decide to use both weapons together in your build.

<img width="431" height="266" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/947ae7bb-fbf2-4723-913c-96101f48f54d" />

## Daredevil

Tracks duration for **Daredevil Grandmaster dodge buffs**.

<img width="844" height="189" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2dfc44a-60ba-4401-bd94-ede34fc0bde0" />
<img width="818" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60dfe565-b3b6-4221-ba99-f9ea695ce123" />

While in combat, if the trait **Havoc Specialist** is equipped and endurance is at full, an extra indicator over your endurance will appear to remind you of uptime. If you don't like this, you can disable the Havoc Specialist element in the pack under Thief > Daredevil.

<img width="875" height="203" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/388a5fc8-5c20-40eb-8a1c-b05b53291dcf" />

# Necromancer

## Spear Soul Shards

Adds an indicator for **Soul Shards** when wielding a spear (Or when having at least 1 shard while in shroud).

<img width="803" height="259" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5daf3247-d931-4fee-86af-68e16371baba" />
<img width="861" height="293" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6599f90-535f-4001-85f3-07cb0578901c" />

While playing as Ritualist or Scourge, the shards will be centered instead:

<img width="883" height="234" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6abe5eba-ccbb-47b8-89d3-5504ccc28823" />

You can also use the centered UI on Reaper or Harbinger if you'd prefer, by changing the filter to include them and disabling the other Spear UI:

<img width="249" height="118" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6026339e-91b5-43e4-9245-d58023e29eca" />

<img width="484" height="546" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d996a6c0-3f16-4e15-a096-9e8c825fb183" />

## Harbinger

Adds a **Blight** bar on top of life force, with notches every 5 stacks, to easily keep track of thresholds to use elixirs in. 

<img width="794" height="247" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1e608b7-776a-42e2-a0d2-a6b5145be70d" />

# Mesmer

## Chronomancer

Adds a bar to track **Continuum Split** duration.

<img width="821" height="219" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ed903f7-2094-4dc6-b3f0-e5b974032b7a" />

## Mirage

Tracks **Phantom Pain** stacks if the trait is equipped. This is an optional DPS Mirage trait so I don't consider this pack particularly necessary, but I found use out of it when learning power mirage, so I figured people might like it.

<img width="438" height="237" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/996a1281-114c-41e6-8b73-7f0f68e99b93" />

## Troubadour

Improves the contrast of **Troubadour notes UI**. A simple cover-up this time, but I felt like the default UI was pretty bad in terms of visibility.

<img width="427" height="244" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7993068-8d5f-4b63-8576-a280276a27e1" />
<img width="409" height="222" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d4a941b-c83c-4f0a-ae57-4de663146c91" />

# Elementalist

## Pistol

Keeps track of **Elemental Bullets** for the pistol.

<img width="880" height="273" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75c9fe57-3052-4335-b0c3-742d2856e246" />


## Hammer

Keeps track of **Elemental Orbs** for the hammer.

<img width="425" height="206" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f6e371b-85a0-4882-a10f-ae2283a68772" />

## Spear

Tracks when your **full charge Etchings** are available. 
Unfortunately, due to reffect limitations, individual charge levels are not trackable.

<img width="402" height="241" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e684b95a-e522-41e5-add3-4514f6b485c4" />

<img width="399" height="235" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4388a95-b08c-4917-8807-293dc1862dc6" />

<img width="360" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/264a218b-5d7d-4e5e-9434-e45b999c77de" />


## Weaver

If you have **Weave Self** equipped, tracks its cooldown and duration, as well as Perfect Weave's duration during its window. 
Weave Self will be highlighted slightly if you are in combat and the skill is not on cooldown to let you know you should use it.

Contains two versions, one anchored to the profession bar and another one on top of your health similar to Ranger's F5 skills.

**Option A**

<img width="904" height="198" alt="image_2025-10-30_16-20-36 (2)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e9e88f8-5ef6-4db9-a6a7-0613053a0554" />
<img width="810" height="195" alt="image_2025-10-30_16-20-36 (3)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81079104-1da6-48ad-a006-66ca5692402f" />
<img width="881" height="253" alt="image_2025-10-30_16-20-35" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11d30649-bbdb-4654-82cd-9af89c74d570" />

**Option B**

<img width="848" height="242" alt="image_2025-10-30_16-56-19 (3)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdf44d88-3137-4bb7-8d88-5442026373b1" />
<img width="792" height="210" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a80b038e-ed52-4c7e-a0b0-258202aa3864" />

To choose which version to use, expand the Weaver group and toggle them:

<img width="270" height="180" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebbbd102-7bb4-4189-8485-14f14c9e03e2" />


## Catalyst

Tracks your stacks of **Elemental Empowerment**, obtained from multiple trait sources, up to 10.

<img width="407" height="192" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8920a4a1-2586-4a35-945b-0d502baaa480" />
<img width="412" height="185" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/225e38f5-658c-481e-b94b-e14d770fb15a" />

If the trait **Empowering Auras** is equipped, an additional element will track its stacks as well. The icon will blink when the buff is under 3 seconds to remind you to reapply an aura, since it refreshes all stacks when you do:

<img width="416" height="202" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6efaf88b-a8b7-4974-8d34-b0e5c0e36b1b" />

If the trait **Empowered Empowerment** is equipped, the bar will glow when at full charge. If you find the effect distracting, you can disable it under Elemental Empowerment > Pulse.

<img width="394" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f3bb07b-a7d2-4ebb-9724-62b82e212443" />
<img width="284" height="179" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb733505-d346-4927-94e8-bab4841eecb0" />

<img width="274" height="175" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbfb8d60-1483-45a0-8c7a-c39f18990eb1" />


## Evoker

(WIP)

An update for Evoker is planned, but Reffect needs to be updated to be able to track when skills don't have the resource to be cast (greyed out lightning graphic state).

# Support Boons

In addition to the class packs, there's an element that will notify you when you don't have **Quickness / Alacrity** if:

a) You have equipped a boon support trait for your corresponding elite spec. <sup>1</sup> 

b) You are in combat.

c) You don't currently have the boon associated with the trait.

A matching pulsing icon will appear over your weapon swap: 

<img width="355" height="235" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e7cbe88-dc13-4872-8c05-b1409087352f" />

<sup>1</sup>  *Except Renegade, as their alacrity generation is tied to gear choices. Their support trait merely improves their alacrity generation, it doesn't enable it.*

If you don't like this feature you can simply disable the Boons element in the pack:

<img width="241" height="309" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4be2d296-747a-48e4-bc16-81003f18faee" />


**Note:** Evoker's boon support trait, **Familiar's Blessing**, is a special case that requires a custom setup. It will make both alacrity and quickness blink if you don't have them, despite not being specialized in the appropriate Element to provide them. Generally this will not be an issue in group content since the other boon will be provided by your support. However, if you are always playing a quickness or alacrity build specifically, you can enable / disable the corresponding boon for Evoker specifically:
