# Profession-Mechanic-Megapack

A collection of additional visual elements for a few profession mechanics and weapons with hard to track buff icons or trait interactions.
Some of them feature minor animations so they will look better in motion!

A few examples (You can see an in-depth list of features after the How to use section):

**Thief Spear combo tracking**

# How to Use

First, download the zip file to your reffect root folder like so:

<img width="516" height="201" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/151e93b4-5901-4aa6-a287-ec6ad61b33d2" />

Then right click > Extract here (the necessary files will be added to the packs and icons subfolders).

Then, return to reffect ingame and refresh packs.

Finally, enable your interface size of choice:

<img width="210" height="116" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9dcbfa0-9476-4101-aed2-ecacdb1a3976" />

<img width="589" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8e6cf96-18f7-4a0c-b00e-c8b0c2d9a68d" />

Some features have additional options you may want to look into as well, which you can enable much in the same way. They will be listed in the corresponding category.

# Features

# Warrior

## Berserker

Tracks  **Berserk mode duration**, which can be increased dynamically through Rage skills or certain traits.
This is intended to be used mostly for people learning the spec, to warn you about berserk mode extensions. 
Contains two options. Type 1 is based off of the revenant energy bar. Type 2 is a more simplified version.

Due to limitations on how reffect tracks buffs, durations over 5 seconds cannot be tracked, so this bar will cap at 5 seconds, and display arrows if you are over the cap.
While under 5 seconds, the bar will start to drain, and the berserk icon will pulse.

Also, due to a fairly common bug with mounting resetting the F2 skill, the bar has been kept at a size where it fits outside of Berserk mode, so that it doesn't overlap graphics if this bug ocurs. It also makes it fit snuggly when outside of berserk. Unfortunately, this is a game bug and thus, unless fixed by the devs, cannot be avoided.

**Type 1**

<img width="795" height="191" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fdaa35d-ee87-4803-9541-1f6b97611dbe" />
<img width="408" height="174" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26cd25c7-8c99-4da1-a954-ce3d022d135a" />
<img width="418" height="217" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30214aca-e6db-409f-ba95-1cec7a5c2f18" />

**Type 2**

<img width="384" height="198" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23730a21-9770-4c21-841a-61739e6a9e08" />

Can be toggled under Warrior > Berserker:

## Spellbreaker

Tracks stacks of **Attacker's Insight** (up to 5) which is obtained on disable or boonstrip, granting 50 Power, Precision and Ferocity per stack. 
This mechanic is quite crucial to maximizing Spellbreaker damage and felt like it was a part of its core design.

<img width="815" height="176" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6a2b3a3-81d6-4d97-89c9-01c79079edbf" />
<img width="840" height="204" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af7fbecb-5847-43cf-898e-973f4d5a18cb" />

# Guardian

## Firebrand

Tracks stacks of **Swift Scholar**, obtained once per tome skill. Since the buff **grants pages once you reach the third stack** and removes itself, it will only go up to 2. Because of this, there are two options for this UI so you can pick whichever is more intuitive for you. 2 bars or 3 bars with the first filling up inmediately. In either case, you will be granted a page when using a tome skill when the bar is full.

<img width="467" height="212" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b13e2bd-ec92-4b2e-a54a-8e17a4640ef8" />
<img width="436" height="220" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25799016-2d59-4c04-8e81-8dedc5a65a17" />

## Willbender

Tracks **Willbender Flames' buffs** on the profession UI

<img width="395" height="254" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3b0fd2e-ca22-430c-85d4-bba5d7811c48" />

## Luminary

Tracks **Luminary's Blessing** and currently **equipped Radiant Weapon buff**, in and out of Forge.

<img width="438" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1077c2de-01e7-4034-90a6-a5598e1e1c82" />

If **Sovereign of Light** is equipped, additionally **tracks Light Aura**, so you know when to detonate it.

<img width="406" height="179" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb7a9517-3eb2-4613-93e5-16e16887ac31" />

If **Empowered Armaments** is equipped, adds an additional tracker for its duration.

<img width="395" height="225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e106a78-25eb-48d0-92c3-26678556a484" />


Additionally, turns the separator between F3 and F4 black to be consistent with other elite specs.

# Revenant

## Spear

Tracks the stack count of **Abyssal Raze** and, if the duration is under 5 seconds, will also display it's timer.

<img width="147" height="137" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0c74e13-dd94-43b1-96fa-a1fbedab29bb" />

## Conduit

Tracks **Affinity** over the health bar, styled after Razah's helmet.

<img width="788" height="323" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4a439be-585f-45ba-bdfd-7b235c5c4c93" />
<img width="919" height="304" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74bad7d8-8e37-4401-b905-c154afff5aba" />

Tracks **Cosmic Wisdom** duration along with your **active form**. 

<img width="477" height="281" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/619933b2-af2c-4290-a9ba-7c61706fe2d4" />
<img width="401" height="310" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adb62077-8aac-46c1-a24d-3e7e682d7a32" />

If **Kinetic Insight** is equipped adds 2 Affinity, but not over 5.

<img width="879" height="277" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7503e84-8a85-44a9-9ee4-4e7b17b11d66" />
<img width="809" height="283" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a2b8220-de66-45f0-915e-8ebdf274bddb" />

# Ranger

## Untamed

Helps tracking **Unleash Pet / Unleash Ranger state**. It also **tracks Unleashed Power (trait) cooldown** to let you know when you are ready to unleash.

When in Unleash Pet state, and Unleashed Power is available (both icons on the left side line up) you'll be ready to Ambush.

<img width="768" height="309" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9852d0f-d7ac-4179-b78a-0f2abf321e00" />

During Ambush windows, the Untamed icon will light up. This checks for if your skill slot 1 has any of the ambush skills available.

<img width="802" height="312" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fb17e78-ca3d-4da9-95fc-b5594d581782" />

If the Let Loose trait is equipped, an additional element will be added. This time lining up on the right side, as you must be in Unleashed Ranger state to perform this. It will indicate when you are ready to get an Ambush by weapon swapping:

<img width="928" height="330" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/592945b3-5224-4736-9abb-f294958f5c4e" />

- Note: Due to technical limitations with reffect, this is achieved by tracking your current weapon swap cooldown. Bear in mind this trait only works in combat, so it will appear to have a very short 1 second cooldown out of combat. Additionally, any change to your weapon swap reduction, like Relic of the Warrior, will shorten your weapon swap and make it not align with the trait cooldown, and thus is not recommended to be used with this trait.

## Galeshot

Used to track **Wind Force stacks**. 
Additionally, an option to add a duplicate **arrow counter** above it is also included. Since both resources are tied together, I find this easier to keep track of than the regular arrow UI. 
If you feel like this display is too much clutter, you can disable the Feathers group

<img width="386" height="259" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c59dc7ba-2785-4064-a12a-d921ebe5a5bc" />

<img width="218" height="95" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58faa031-d94e-4e4f-9041-56b219f44491" />

# Engineer

A lot of people requested a way to keep track of **kit skill cooldowns**. Cooldown trackers for hidden skills is specifically against the rules for addons, so it will **not be supported**.

## Amalgam

Tracks **Evolve** and **Strain** durations. 

<img width="424" height="281" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07943e30-81b1-42ac-b303-dc799873ce4f" />

Also tracks **Willing Host**.

<img width="378" height="232" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94ce33b4-af74-49ce-a798-73ecd739bfea" />


If **Silver Lining** is equipped, strains will be tracked individually. 
(They will display on top of Morph skills, although their position will not necessarily match the corresponding Morph skill, as reffect doesn't allow to track both buff and skill cooldowns at the same time).

<img width="392" height="222" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87f81386-386b-4b4d-8121-0444e4148d6f" />

# Thief

## Stealth

Displays Stealth and Revealed over Profession Skill 1.

<img width="447" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ce64064-3d49-4d3d-b40d-e853d90ed02b" />
<img width="421" height="242" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/670e4a3b-8760-4ab7-82b4-d08093948f76" />

## Spear

Helps keep track of the **Spear's Combo Chains**, as well as **Distracting Throw**'s uptime.

This pack comes with two options. Spear icons or simple icons. Spear icons use the icons for slot 2 since they have generally more distinctive graphics, being animal themed:

<img width="470" height="247" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38b3caab-7fef-4fa9-9569-433350776819" />
<img width="427" height="235" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c6cc342-8aa4-46c2-9d41-a8014bdc05f2" />

Simple mode, closely resembling initiative:

<img width="402" height="220" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/120553f7-1ada-4b77-8286-6de0528d57bc" />

Enable / Disable Icons or Simple Icons under Thief Spear:

<img width="228" height="159" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6a52fd4-ef65-4fd6-b1c0-9ae949061269" />

**Note**

I wanted to have this element centered over initiative, but because of the special action button, this would cause overlap when it appears, so by default it's out of the way. If you'd prefer to have it centered, despite it being covered when SAK appears, you can just move it under Thief > Thief Spear.

<img width="421" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecf48e6f-a7f3-4036-b96f-a1bbfb86bf95" />


## Axe

Tracks the number of active axes. Also, if at max stacks, the axe icon will light up. You may disable this if you like.

<img width="451" height="248" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d9be557-a1cb-450c-bcf4-5c720f99b634" />
<img width="366" height="268" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3431e37-1ac3-4663-bb67-12d8a2a06728" />
<img width="471" height="274" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fee3300-5cae-4279-bf8b-aa718500200e" />

**Note**

If you use the Axe and Spear together, they might overlap, and you will have to move one of them out of the way. Since thief generally doesn't use two weapons actively due to how initiative works, and it's rare to use Spear and Axe together, I left them in their default position. You can move them if you decide to use both weapons together in your build.

<img width="431" height="266" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/947ae7bb-fbf2-4723-913c-96101f48f54d" />

## Daredevil

Tracks duration for **Daredevil Grandmaster dodge buffs**.

<img width="844" height="189" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2dfc44a-60ba-4401-bd94-ede34fc0bde0" />
<img width="818" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60dfe565-b3b6-4221-ba99-f9ea695ce123" />

While in combat, if the trait **Havoc Specialist** is equipped and endurance is at full, an extra indicator over your endurance will appear to remind you of uptime. If you don't like this, you can disable the Havoc Specialist element in the pack under Thief > Daredevil.

<img width="875" height="203" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/388a5fc8-5c20-40eb-8a1c-b05b53291dcf" />



# Notes

Any effect duration based bar will be capped at 5 seconds, as durations over 5 seconds cannot be tracked by reffect for any effect that's not a boon or condition.
